                                Varanasi is one of the oldest living cities in the world. Its
                                Prominence in Hindu mythology is virtually unrevealed. Mark
                                Twain, the English author and literature, who was enthralled
                                by the legend and sanctity of Benaras, once wrote, ''Benaras
                                is older than history, older than tradition, older even than
                                legend and looks twice as old as all of them put together".

                                October to March is the best time to visit Varanasi because
                                most of the fairs here are held during this time of the year.
                                Festivities begin with Diwali and continue to Dev Diwali
                                celebrated on the 15th day from Diwali. In between, there is
                                also Annakut. During this time, the ghats are lit with lights
                                and diyas. Earthen lamps adorn the staircase of the ghats and
                                are also afloat in the river. Firecrackers burn through the
                                night, and it's a sight no one should miss.

                                When visiting Varanasi, one comes across plenty of ghats, but
                                among them, Dashashwamedh Ghat is said to be one of the oldest
                                and most important. This ghat, leading to the Ganges, is
                                located close to the famous old Vishwanath temple in Kashi
                                (todayâ€™s Banaras). Another famous attraction is River Ganges
                                which is the holiest river by the Hindus and many more.
